# hello-world
An initial, tutorial repository where I can store ideas, images, licenses, etc. 

My name is James Calhoon, My goal is to be a web designer someday although I know I have a long way to go.
I am also a huge nerd that probably knows way too much about the Transformers franchise for their own good. 

30 Commits Assignment

#1: It is a lovely day outside.

#2: I am listening to the Pokemon Snap OST while doing this assignment.

#3: I am also doing some laundrey while working on this assignment.

#4: I am also trying to figure out some of the GitHub formatting while doing this.

#5: For example, if I want this to appear as a list and not a giant paragraph, I have to have a break between each line.

#6: I am actually glad that I am taking this class this semester.

#7: I tried taking it last semester, but it was clear that the teacher was either new or had no idea what he was doing.

#8: At least Prof. Romrell knows what he is doing and can explain things easier.

#9: I'm also glad that I am taking this class in the Summer semester.

#10: It means that I can pour all of my attention and effort into this class instead of balancing it between four other classes.

#11: I wish that I could do that with all of my classes.

#12: But FASFA really doesn't like the one or two classes per semester approach.

#13: Plus, I've already been in college for way too long.

#14: I probably shouldn't have changed my major, but I can't stand being graded on Creative Writing where there are expectations put on something that should be inherently subjective.

#15: Woo! Half-way there!

#16: Also, is there some kind of spell-check on GitHub? I realized that might be an issue while typing "inherently" in #13.

#17: Man, listening to this OST really makes me want to play Pokemon Snap again.

#18: Unfortunately, I left my old Nintendo 64 back at home.

#19: Which is a bit of a shame really because the Nintendo 64 was a great, classic system.

#20: It had a ton of great games on it besides just Pokemon Snap like:

#21: Super Mario 64

#22: Pokemon Stadium

#23: Star Fox 64

#24: The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time & Majora's Mask

#25: Mario Party 1, 2, and 3. 

#26: Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire & Rogue Squadron

#27: Banjo Kazooie and Tooie.

#28: Perfect Dark and Golden Eye

#29: And so many more that I am not sure if I could list every one of them.

#30: Thanks to that list of Nintendo 64 titles, it seems that my assignment has reached its end.
